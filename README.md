My projects in Computer Networks

INTRODUCTION:
GNS3 is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to
emulate, model, test and troubleshoot virtual and real-world
networks. GNS3 allows you to run a small topology consisting of only a few
devices on your laptop, or many devices hosted on multiple
servers or even hosted in the cloud.
GNS3 is open source software, free of charge, that can be downloaded from http://gns3.com
GNS3 can help those seeking a certification such as Cisco CCNA, but
and will also help you test and verify your knowledge of Computer Networks.
GNS3 in the beginning was used for virtualization (virtualizarion) only CISCO
devices, using a software called Dynamips. GNS3 has now
evolved to support multiple devices from multiple network vendors,
including Cisco Virtual Switches, Cisco Asas, Brocade Vruters, Cumulus Linux
switches, Docker instances, HPE VSRs, multiple Linux devices and more.
